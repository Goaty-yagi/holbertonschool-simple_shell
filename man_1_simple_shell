SIMPLE_SHELL(1)                 User Commands                 SIMPLE_SHELL(1)

NAME
       simple_shell - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
       Simple_shell is a minimalistic UNIX command line interpreter that
       allows users to execute commands in an interactive or non-interactive
       mode.

       In interactive mode, simple_shell displays a prompt and waits for the
       user to type a command. The prompt is displayed again after each
       command execution.

       In non-interactive mode, simple_shell reads commands from standard input
       or a file and executes them.

OPTIONS
       Simple_shell does not support command-line options.

COMMANDS
       Simple_shell supports the following commands:

       ls
              Display the contents of the current directory.

       exit
              Exit the shell.

       env
              Print the current environment.

ERROR HANDLING
       If an executable cannot be found, simple_shell prints an error message
       and displays the prompt again.

       Simple_shell handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D) gracefully.

EXAMPLES
       $ ./simple_shell
       # ls
       file1 file2
       # exit
       
       $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell
       file1 file2

COMPILATION
       Simple_shell can be compiled using the following command:

       $ make
